# Introduction

A base4 computer works in base 4. In base 2, we have 0 and 1. In base 3, we have -1, 0 and 1. In base 4, we consider -1, -0.5, 0, 0.5 and 1. 

## Base4 numbers 

As we have -1, -0.5, 0, 0.5 and 1 in base 4, we can model them like this : 

| Decimal | Binary | 
|:--------:|:------:|
|-1       |  111    |
|-0.5     |  110    |
|0        |  000    |
|0.5      |  010    | 
|1        |  001    | 

As you can see, we modeled base 4 numbers in binary. 

## Logic gates 
In this project, we have the goal of implementing logic gates for base 4 computers, including NOT, AND and OR. Then, all gates implementation will be possible.
